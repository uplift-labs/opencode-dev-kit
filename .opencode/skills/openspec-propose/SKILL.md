# OpenSpec Propose

Use this skill when the user wants to create a new OpenSpec change or turn an explored idea into implementation-ready artifacts.

For broad or unclear user work where it is not yet known whether OpenSpec is required, use `adaptive-delivery` first to choose the lane. For unstable requirements, use `openspec-explore` before drafting proposal/spec/tasks.

## Workflow

- Choose a concise change id using the repository's naming convention.
- Read existing capabilities and active changes to avoid duplicate or conflicting scope.
- For broad proposals with independent capability, source, docs, or test evidence tracks, consider `orchestrator` for discovery before drafting; keep small or unstable-scope proposals serial.
- Define problem, goals, non-goals, risks, rollout/migration, and validation.
- Write normative requirements as scenarios with observable outcomes.
- Create tasks that map to requirements, tests, docs, and validation gates; order behavior-changing tasks as test/characterization first, implementation second, validation third.
- Include explicit archive readiness tasks for spec sync, validation evidence, and unresolved follow-up handling; do not add retrospective ceremony.
- Keep future-scope work out unless explicitly accepted for this change.

## Task Shape

Every new OpenSpec `tasks.md` should keep archive readiness explicit without requiring a retrospective file. Use concise sections such as `Implementation`, `Validation`, and `Archive Readiness` when helpful.

## Follow-Up Backlog Mode

Use this mode when converting several concrete session-scoped follow-ups from an audit, reviewer gate, or validation failure into OpenSpec tracking.

- Do not create one change per tiny note. Group only evidence-backed tasks that are related to the session and outside the current approved scope.
- Prefer one change per coherent outcome, capability, risk area, or artifact family; split only when validation, ownership, or implementation order differs materially.
- `tasks.md` may be the primary backlog surface for lightweight follow-up changes. Keep `proposal.md` brief but explicit about source evidence, scope, non-goals, and why tracking is needed.
- Add spec deltas, scenarios, or `design.md` only when normative behavior, compatibility, architecture, migration, or acceptance criteria need a durable source of truth.
- Carry audit/reviewer/validation evidence into the change so later `next-step` and `openspec-apply-change` runs do not depend on memory or loose final-message bullets.
- For prevention feedback, preserve `Prevention Target`, recurrence path, draft rule, and replay evidence when the user explicitly chooses OpenSpec tracking instead of ledger-only follow-up.

## Output

Return or create, depending on user mode:

- `proposal.md`: why, what changes, impact, non-goals.
- `design.md`: decisions, alternatives, risks, compatibility, operational model.
- `specs/<capability>/spec.md`: added/modified/removed requirements and scenarios.
- `tasks.md`: implementation, validation, and archive-readiness checklist.
- `traceability.md` when the repository uses one.
- `Validation`: OpenSpec commands run or skipped with reason.

Do not start implementation until the spec boundary is stable or the user explicitly asks to proceed.
