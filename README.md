# opencode-dev-kit

Installable OpenCode development kit for reusable AI-assisted engineering workflows across projects.

## What This Is

`opencode-dev-kit` packages reusable OpenCode skills, read-only reviewer and worker agents, project templates, instruction templates, and deterministic helper tools. Its purpose is to make work in other repositories faster, cheaper in tokens, and safer without creating a different workflow for every technology stack.

The kit optimizes one process: gather evidence, prove current state, choose the smallest useful slice, work test-first when behavior changes, validate, run proportional reviewer gates, and hand off with residual risks.

## Universal Development Loop

The central contract is `instructions/universal-development-loop.md`:

```text
Intake -> Evidence -> Baseline Proof -> Small Slice -> Test First -> Implement -> Focused Validation -> Review Gate -> Final Validation -> Handoff -> Process Improvement
```

Technology adapters may change commands and constraints, but not the loop.

## Contents

- `.opencode/skills/`: reusable OpenCode skills.
- `.opencode/agents/`: reusable read-only reviewer and worker agents.
- `instructions/`: copyable instruction templates for global/project `AGENTS.md`, reviewer contracts, evidence discipline, and porting.
- `templates/`: project bootstrap and CI templates for applying the Universal Development Loop to another repository.
- `profiles/`: install manifests that choose artifacts without creating separate workflows.
- `tools/`: TypeScript validation, install, project bootstrap, doctor, inventory, code-quality, and OpenCode session-retro ledger tooling for this kit.

## Prerequisites

- Node `>=24` is required because repository tooling runs TypeScript entrypoints directly.
- `npm test`, `npm run retro:inventory`, `npm run retro:analyze`, and `npm run retro:project-ledger` use Node's `node:sqlite`; Node may print an `ExperimentalWarning` while the API remains experimental.

## Install

### Global Install

Install all repository skills, all reviewer agents, and a reusable global `AGENTS.md` block into OpenCode's global config directory:

```sh
npm run install:global
```

By default this installs into `~/.config/opencode`, syncs every repository skill to `skills/`, syncs every repository agent to `agents/`, and adds `instructions/global-opencode-agent-instructions.md` as an idempotent marked block in `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` without deleting existing user instructions. Full sync prunes destination skill directories and agent `.md` files that are not present in the selected install set. Existing changed or pruned files/directories are backed up under `.backups/agents-and-skills/` before replacement/removal, outside OpenCode's loader folders.

Useful options:

- `--dry-run` or `--what-if`: preview changes without writing files.
- `--config-dir <path>`: install into a custom OpenCode config directory.
- `--profile <standard|strict|advanced>`: restrict the installed artifact set without changing the Universal Development Loop.
- `--agents-md-source <path>`: install a custom source file into the global `AGENTS.md` block.
- `--skip-agents-md`: install only skills and agents.
- `--no-prune`: keep destination skills/agents not present in this repository.
- `--no-backup`: replace changed or pruned artifacts without creating backup copies.

Use `--agents-md-source AGENTS.md` only if you intentionally want this repository's local maintenance rules in the global `AGENTS.md` block.

Restart OpenCode after installing; config-time files are loaded at startup.

Keep project-specific skills out of global discovery unless their descriptions explicitly scope them to that project. Global skills are visible in unrelated repositories through the skill catalog, so broad or local-product triggers add avoidable routing noise.

## Bootstrap A Project

Preview the files that would connect a target project to the Universal Development Loop:

```sh
npm run init:project -- --target <project-path>
```

Write the bootstrap files when the preview is correct:

```sh
npm run init:project -- --target <project-path> --mode write
```

The bootstrap writes a project `AGENTS.md`, optional `opencode.json`, and `opencode-dev-kit/adapter.json` plus `opencode-dev-kit/validation.md`. The adapter records technology-specific commands; it does not define a separate workflow.

Check readiness after bootstrapping:

```sh
npm run doctor -- --project <project-path>
```

Before broad AI work in a target repository, gather a compact deterministic map:

```sh
npm run project:inventory -- --root <project-path> --format markdown
```

## Token Economy

- Use the Universal Development Loop instead of choosing among competing workflows.
- Use `project:inventory`, `code-quality:inventory`, `glob`, and `grep` before broad file reads.
- On native Windows, use `rtk <command>` explicitly for shell-heavy read-only commands; do not rely on hook auto-rewrite.
- Use Headroom MCP tools only on demand for large logs, search results, JSON, or tool outputs; retrieve originals before trusting exact code, errors, or safety-critical details.
- Route Headroom MCP through `tools/headroom-mcp-wrapper.ts` when OpenCode expects MCP prompts; the wrapper adds a small `headroom_usage_policy` prompt and proxies Headroom tools unchanged.
- Keep heavyweight skills in optional profiles and load them only when they reduce total work.
- Run focused validation first; run broad validation when the change crosses boundaries.
- Use one relevant reviewer gate by risk instead of launching every reviewer.
- Convert repeated manual counting, drift checks, or report assembly into deterministic helpers.

Inspect this kit's instruction context cost with:

```sh
npm run instruction:inventory -- --format markdown
```

### Manual Skills

OpenCode skills are loaded from project or global skill folders. Copy selected skill folders from `.opencode/skills/` into one of these locations:

- Project: `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Global: `~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

Alternatively, add this repository's skills path to an OpenCode config:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "paths": ["<path-to-agents-and-skills>/.opencode/skills"]
  }
}
```

Use an absolute path or a path relative to the config file that declares it.

### Manual Agents

OpenCode agents are loaded from project or global agent folders. Copy selected files from `.opencode/agents/` into one of these locations:

- Project: `.opencode/agents/<name>.md`
- Global: `~/.config/opencode/agents/<name>.md`

Copy only the agents that are useful for the target project. They are read-only leaf validators or bounded read-only workers by default.

### Manual Commands

OpenCode prompt commands are configured through `opencode.json` under `command`. This repository does not currently ship project commands.

### Manual Instructions

Copy selected files from `instructions/` into a global or project `AGENTS.md` or another instruction file. Keep only rules that are durable for that scope.

## Validate

Run structural validation and fixture-based acceptance checks after changing library artifacts:

```sh
npm run validate
npm test
```

The validator checks skill and agent frontmatter shape, skill trigger/output contracts, compact reviewer leaf contracts, README catalog/routing sync, repo/project-template autonomy and remote/destructive guards, TypeScript-only development policy, deterministic helper automation policy, reusable reviewer permission policy, OpenCode config warnings for broad mutation-capable wildcard `allow` permissions, optional project-neutral anchors passed via `--forbidden-anchor`, trailing whitespace, and warning-level TDD guard findings for Markdown artifacts with implementation-related language that do not mention test-first, TDD, before-code fixtures/gates, or equivalent validation-first language.

For code maintainability reviews in this library, gather deterministic file-size/navigation bands with:

```sh
npm run code-quality:inventory -- --format markdown
```

For instruction-artifact context-cost reviews in this kit, gather deterministic Markdown metrics with:

```sh
npm run instruction:inventory -- --format markdown
```

Validate all OpenSpec changes with the first-class package gate:

```sh
npm run openspec:validate
```

Run deterministic operation gates before sensitive OpenSpec lifecycle steps with:

```sh
npm run openspec:gate -- --operation apply --change <change-id>
npm run openspec:gate -- --operation archive --change <change-id>
npm run openspec:gate -- --operation prepush
```

Use `--persist` only when a JSON evidence artifact should be written to `openspec/changes/<change-id>/automation/operation-gates/<operation>.json` from a write-authorized main session. Default operation-gate runs are read-only.

Before archiving a completed OpenSpec change, create/update retrospective follow-ups with the mutating helper, then validate the read-only retrospective archive gate with:

```sh
npm run openspec:retro-followups -- <change-id>
npm run openspec:retro-gate -- <change-id>
```

Use `npm run openspec:retro-followups -- <change-id> --dry-run` for read-only inspection. Without `--dry-run`, the follow-up helper reads actionable problem entries from `openspec/changes/<change-id>/automation/retro.json`, creates/updates OpenSpec follow-up changes before archive, and updates JSON follow-up ids. The retro gate then checks that `tasks.md` ends with `Retrospective Before Archive`, `automation/retro.json` exists, required schema fields are present, approved skips include reason and approver, actionable problems include `rootCause`, and actionable findings reference real follow-up changes with `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, and `specs/<generated-id>/spec.md` that preserve the retrospective evidence and root cause.

For installer changes, also prove the no-write path before using a real config directory:

```sh
npm run install:global -- --dry-run --config-dir <temp-config-dir>
```

For ports from a project-local prompt set, pass anchors that must not remain in reusable Markdown:

```sh
npm run validate -- --forbidden-anchor "OldProductName" "D:/old/project/path"
```

Before pushing changes from this repository, run the pre-push gate:

```sh
npm run prepush:validate
```

The pre-push gate runs `npm run validate`, `npm run openspec:gate -- --operation prepush` when `openspec/` exists, `npm test`, and `npm run openspec:validate`.

To enable the tracked local git hook for this clone, run:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

For broad instruction-artifact audits, use `instructions/instruction-artifact-audit-runbook.md` to prove repo source, installed state, runtime policy, context-cost metrics, permission semantics, reviewer gates, and non-repo changes. Capture before/after metrics such as global rules line count, top heavy skill line counts, installed-copy drift, validator test count, and reviewer findings.

## Session Retro Inventory And Analysis

Before running `all-sessions-retro`, generate a redacted coverage and batching ledger for locally reachable OpenCode session stores:

```sh
npm run retro:inventory -- --format markdown
```

For machine-readable fan-out manifests, write JSON only when the output path is approved for generated ledgers:

```sh
npm run retro:inventory -- --format json --out <ledger-path>
```

The inventory tool reads OpenCode SQLite stores in read-only mode, classifies Desktop state files without emitting raw prompts, redacts session IDs/project names/paths by default, and suggests stable batches for later evidence review. Use `--db <path>`, `--data-dir <path>`, or `--desktop-dir <path>` for explicit sources, `--only-explicit` to disable default path discovery, and `--show-paths` only when home-redacted source paths are acceptable. Existing `--out` files are refused unless `--overwrite` is passed explicitly.

After inventory, gather deterministic structured metrics without transcript-content heuristics:

```sh
npm run retro:analyze -- --format markdown
```

The analysis tool reads OpenCode SQLite stores in read-only mode and emits redacted schema/table counts, session/day/project/agent/model buckets, message/part JSON envelope counts, tool names/statuses, input key names, deterministic tool-error categories, open TODO counts, edit/validation/git-review readiness proxies, event types, and session summary counters. It does not emit raw prompts, command values, session titles, project names, workspace names, stable IDs, account tokens, or share secrets.

For current-project retros, initialize a generated working ledger before synthesis:

```sh
npm run retro:project-ledger -- init --project-root <project-path>
```

Run from the target repository when this tooling is available there. `init` writes `<project-path>/retro.json` by default. If running from this kit repository for another target, pass `--project-root <target-project>`, `--root <target-project>`, and write `--out <target-project>/retro.json` unless an approved temp path is being used.

Root `retro.json` is a temporary, machine-checkable ledger for the chain `sessions -> per-session audit -> observations -> trends -> root causes -> plans -> OpenSpec proposals`. The helper reads OpenCode SQLite stores in read-only mode, filters sessions to the project root, emits redacted session skeletons, and keeps raw ids, titles, prompts, project paths, and transcript text out by default. `analysisProgress` records the chronological session order, last analyzed session, and next session so future runs can resume instead of restarting. Full retros must keep this root ledger; inline summaries are only partial inventory. A completed session must fill `sessions.<sessionRef>.audit` with user goal, constraints, assistant actions, tool failures, validation or skipped reason, edit evidence, user corrections, outcome, lessons, symptom/root-cause notes, confidence, and learning routes before `coverage.status` is set to `complete`. Negative observations must name `mainAgentLearning` and/or `reviewerLearning`; reviewer findings require `mainAgentLearning` so main-agent behavior improves instead of repeating reviewer cycles. Plans use explicit `kind` values: `investigation`, `remediation`, or `preservation`. Fill audit fields/observations/trends/root causes/plans with human judgment, then refresh progress, validate links, and preview proposal writes:

```sh
npm run retro:project-ledger -- refresh --input retro.json
npm run retro:project-ledger -- validate --input retro.json
npm run retro:project-ledger -- proposals --input retro.json --root <project-path> --dry-run
```

After write scope is approved, materialize proposals and run the final strict gate:

```sh
npm run retro:project-ledger -- proposals --input retro.json --root <project-path>
npm run retro:project-ledger -- validate --input retro.json --root <project-path> --require-complete --require-proposals
```

When root `retro.json` exists, `npm run prepush:validate` runs the complete ledger gate before push. Push fails if any session is not complete, any completed session lacks required audit fields, observations are not converted to trends, promoted trends lack root-cause analysis, root causes lack detailed plans, or plans lack generated OpenSpec proposals.

Use `--db`, `--data-dir`, and `--only-explicit` for controlled stores. Use `--show-paths` only when home-redacted paths are acceptable. Existing init output files are refused unless `--overwrite` is passed.

## Routing Map

Routing and reviewer maps assume all/advanced artifacts; restricted profiles use the closest installed core route or install `advanced`/all.

- Broad, unclear, high-risk, or process-sensitive delivery -> `adaptive-delivery`; let it choose direct execution, planning, OpenSpec, architecture, orchestration, or reviewer gates.
- Explicit planning-only work -> `deep-task-planning`; if the request is broad delivery rather than planning-only, start with `adaptive-delivery`.
- Existing OpenSpec continuation or "what next" work -> `next-step` from the `advanced` profile; accepted OpenSpec implementation -> `openspec-apply-change`; new OpenSpec packages -> `openspec-propose`; consistency/archive work -> the matching OpenSpec review/archive skill.
- Several session-scoped follow-ups from an audit, retro, reviewer gate, broad discovery, or validation failure -> group them into lightweight OpenSpec changes with `openspec-propose` when OpenSpec exists or is approved and the advanced profile is available; otherwise return grouped continuation candidates.
- Initial MR/PR title/body preparation -> `merge-request-author`; existing MR/PR checks, reviewer feedback, approvals, and outcome handling -> `merge-request-review-loop`.
- Broad independent tracks -> `orchestrator` from the `advanced` profile only after bounded workstreams, success criteria, and validation evidence are clear; if it is unavailable, use the Universal Development Loop serially or return an orchestration follow-up candidate.
- Bounded first-pass helper work that benefits from cheap/offline local context, such as long-context retrieval, JSON extraction, scoped review, test ideas, planning, or tool-call checks -> `qwen-local-worker` from the `advanced` profile when the target machine has a configured `qwen-local` provider.
- Session delivery-control review for transcript/summary, compaction/resume continuity, user goal, changed files, and validation output -> `session-delivery-reviewer`.
- Skills, agents, prompts, `AGENTS.md`, and other instruction artifacts -> `instruction-artifact-tuning`; bounded/current-project/selected-project OpenCode session, transcript, reflection, and log retros -> `project-sessions-retro` with `retro:project-ledger` when a durable session-to-proposal ledger is needed; all-history/cross-install/whole-corpus retros targeting global skills, agents, prompts, rules, validators, tools, and reusable instructions -> `all-sessions-retro`; for broad audits also use `instruction-artifact-audit-runbook.md`; use `instruction-artifact-reviewer` as the read-only post-change gate.
- Documentation review selection: use `documentation-learning-quest` for guided onboarding, `file-review-quest` for one-file block review, `documentation-hardening-loop` for non-trivial doc/spec hardening, `openspec-consistency-review` for OpenSpec synchronization, and `codebase-audit-loop` only for exhaustive codebase audits.
- Code maintainability/readability after non-trivial implementation, refactoring, large-file navigation, duplication, DRY/SOLID/YAGNI, or design-pattern trade-off work -> `code-quality-audit`; use `code-quality-reviewer` as the read-only gate.

## Reviewer Gate Map

- Instruction artifacts, skills, agents, prompts, `AGENTS.md`, and README routing -> `instruction-artifact-reviewer`.
- Code health, maintainability, readability, file navigation, duplication, boundaries, and pragmatic refactoring -> `code-quality-reviewer`.
- Implementation readiness, stable scope, blockers, validation path -> `implementation-readiness-reviewer`.
- Session delivery alignment, compaction continuity, proportional rigor, missed work, risks, validation/review completeness, and acceptance handoff -> `session-delivery-reviewer`.
- OpenSpec/design/architecture ownership and consistency -> `openspec-architecture-reviewer`.
- Requirements-to-tests, weak assertions, missing gates -> `test-coverage-reviewer`.
- Config, deployment, packaging, operational safety -> `deployment-config-reviewer`.
- Latency, throughput, load isolation, recovery evidence -> `performance-reliability-reviewer`.
- Rust async/concurrency/backpressure/shutdown -> `rust-concurrency-reviewer`.
- Protocol/API semantics, schema evolution, correlation, reconnect -> `protocol-api-reviewer`; byte-level fixtures, framing, golden vectors -> `wire-protocol-reviewer`.
- Legacy source evidence and compatibility behavior -> `legacy-evidence-reviewer`; legacy client/tool workflow compatibility -> `legacy-client-compatibility-reviewer`.

## OpenSpec Follow-Up Tracking

Use OpenSpec as a durable follow-up tracker when a session produces a real backlog, not for every incidental note.

This repository's OpenSpec guide starts at `openspec/project.md`; active changes live under `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`.

- Good triggers: codebase audits, session retros, instruction-artifact audits, reviewer gates, broad discovery, and validation failure triage that produce several concrete tasks outside the current approved scope.
- Bad triggers: isolated nits, speculative polish, local style preferences, duplicated final-answer bullets, or one obvious next step.
- Prefer one OpenSpec change per coherent outcome, capability, risk area, or artifact family. For lightweight backlog changes, `tasks.md` can be the primary surface; add proposal/spec/design detail only when requirements, behavior, compatibility, architecture, or acceptance criteria need it.
- Create or update OpenSpec files only when the repository already has an OpenSpec workflow or the user approved adding one; otherwise return grouped follow-up candidates as continuation items.
- Reviewer agents remain read-only: they recommend OpenSpec follow-up tracking in `Actionable Continuation Items`; the main session owns any file writes and `next-step` continuation.

## OpenSpec Retrospective Gate

Before archiving a completed OpenSpec change, write `openspec/changes/<change-id>/automation/retro.json`, run `npm run openspec:retro-followups -- <change-id>` when available to create/update follow-up OpenSpec changes for actionable findings, then run `npm run openspec:retro-gate -- <change-id>`. New `tasks.md` files should end with `Retrospective Before Archive` so the final learning step is machine-checkable and includes root-cause review.

`automation/retro.json` should stay concise but evidence-backed. It includes `schemaVersion`, `changeId`, `evidenceReviewed`, `problems`, `outputs`, and `archiveGate`. Problem entries use `problem`, `evidence`, `impact`, `rootCause`, `recommendation`, `confidence`, `target`, `followUpChangeId`, and `noFollowUpReason`; actionable recommendations should address the cause or explicitly route an investigation/instrumentation follow-up when the cause is `unknown`. Actionable project-local or reusable skill/agent/instruction/validator findings must become real OpenSpec follow-up changes referenced from JSON outputs; otherwise use `target` `none` only for findings fixed in scope, intentionally non-actionable items, or justified no-follow-up decisions. Approved skips must include a reason and approver.

## Porting Notes

These artifacts were generalized from project-local workflows. Project-specific anchors were removed or renamed into domain-neutral forms:

- Product architecture -> `service-architecture-design`.
- Product protocol implementation -> `framed-protocol-implementation` and `protocol-api-reviewer`.
- Product wire-format review -> `wire-protocol-golden-tests` and `wire-protocol-reviewer`.
- Device/upstream simulator -> `external-service-simulator-harness`.
- Legacy UI/tool compatibility -> `legacy-client-compatibility-reviewer` and `legacy-evidence-reviewer`.
- Production baseline spec authoring -> `production-service-openspec`.

Overly narrow future-scope behavior that depended on one product domain was intentionally not ported.

## Curation Rules

- Keep artifacts project-neutral unless the artifact name explicitly scopes a reusable domain.
- Prefer concrete evidence, validation, permissions, and output schemas over vague instructions.
- For repetitive, evidence-heavy, or token-heavy workflows, consider a small deterministic helper before adding more prose process.
- When several session-scoped follow-ups appear outside approved scope, prefer grouping them into OpenSpec changes when OpenSpec exists or is approved instead of leaving an untracked final-message backlog; avoid OpenSpec ceremony for isolated nits or one obvious next step.
- Helper automation in skills or agents must be deterministic and contract-driven: explicit inputs/outputs, fixtures or schemas, stable ordering, privacy-safe output, and no hidden heuristics.
- Implementation-capable artifacts should require TDD/test-first by default for behavior changes, or require an explicit infeasibility note plus the closest reproducible validation evidence.
- Keep TDD proportional: require the smallest useful test/gate for the scoped behavior, not unrelated coverage expansion or speculative test suites.
- Reviewer agents should keep the compact `Leaf Contract`, ordered findings, residual risks, and `Actionable Continuation Items`; mutation-capable tools stay denied unless a separate validation-enabled profile is intentionally created.
- Avoid hardcoded commands and paths. Use placeholders or say to use the repository's configured validation command.
- If a target repository has stricter local instructions, local instructions win.
