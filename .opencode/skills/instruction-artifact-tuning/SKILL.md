# Instruction Artifact Tuning

Use this skill when the target artifact is an OpenCode skill, subagent, `AGENTS.md`, prompt template, slash-command prompt, guard instruction, or another model-facing instruction file.

Default mode is review-first. Edit only when the user explicitly asks to tune, fix, create, or port artifacts, or when the request clearly implies artifact creation.

For broad audits that include multiple skills/agents, global config, installed copies, or runtime loading policy, use `instructions/instruction-artifact-audit-runbook.md` as the coverage contract before concluding.

## What To Optimize

- Trigger accuracy: the description says when to load the artifact and when it should stay quiet.
- Cohesion: one primary job, one output contract, and no unrelated duties hidden in one prompt.
- Authority clarity: global, repository, skill, agent, and user instructions do not conflict.
- Evidence discipline: docs and user claims are hypotheses until checked against source, tests, schemas, or live output.
- Root-cause discipline: retro, audit, reviewer, and follow-up artifacts separate symptoms from likely root causes, and recommendations explain how recurrence is prevented or reduced.
- Verification: the artifact names concrete checks, commands, reviewer gates, or eval criteria where possible.
- TDD discipline: implementation-capable artifacts require test-first behavior for code changes, or an explicit infeasibility path with substitute validation evidence.
- Tool safety: edit/read-only boundaries, destructive-operation policy, remote-state policy, and permissions are explicit.
- Context efficiency: remove repeated boilerplate, stale examples, source dumps, and project-specific details that should be local.
- AI usability: critical routing, permissions, blockers, and output schema are near the top and easy to retrieve.
- Runtime realism: distinguish startup rules, discovered skill/agent catalogs, on-demand skill content, installed copies, active config, and live loader behavior.
- Deterministic automation opportunities: identify where a small helper could gather, validate, diff, redact, or inventory evidence faster than prose, without replacing judgment.

## Checks

- For skills, ensure `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` matches frontmatter `name`.
- For skills, ensure `description` is specific, concrete, and short enough for OpenCode discovery.
- For agents, ensure frontmatter has a useful `description`, correct `mode`, and least-privilege `permission`.
- Reviewer agents should be leaf validators unless explicitly designed otherwise: no edits, commits, pushes, nested agents, destructive commands, or user questions.
- For behavior-changing instruction artifacts, add or update a minimal loader/schema/eval fixture or validation checklist before editing when feasible; document missing harnesses.
- For retro/audit/reviewer artifacts, require `Likely Root Cause` or `Root Cause` in findings/backlogs, or explicitly route an investigation when the cause is unknown.
- For broad audits, cover repo source, installed state, runtime policy, context-cost metrics, permission semantics, reviewer gates, and non-repo changes using the audit runbook.
- For broad independent artifact inventories, consider `orchestrator` with bounded read-only workers; keep single-artifact or tightly coupled tuning serial.
- When helper code would materially reduce repeated inspection or token use, require an explicit input/output contract, fixture or schema, stable ordering, privacy-safe output, and no hidden heuristics.
- Do not encode fuzzy scoring, probabilistic classification, model-like summarization, trigger-quality ranking, or unstated inference in helper code; unsupported inputs should produce `unknown`, `unreadable`, `unsupported`, or `blocked`.
- Replace project-specific paths, tools, issue trackers, and product names with placeholders unless the artifact is intentionally project-local.
- Remove obsolete instructions instead of adding override paragraphs.
- If review or tuning exposes several concrete artifact follow-ups outside the approved scope, recommend grouping them into OpenSpec follow-up changes rather than expanding the current edit silently or leaving a loose backlog.

## Prevention Feedback Quick Path

Use this quick path only when `instruction-feedback-loop` routes a P0/P1 `Prevention Feedback` block to a cheap instant edit on exactly one `skill:<name>` or one `agent:<name>` file.

- Refuse instant edits for global `AGENTS.md`, files under `instructions/`, files under `templates/`, medium/expensive changes, `new-skill-required`, unknown root cause, or cross-repo ownership; route those through OpenSpec follow-up or investigation.
- Require a persisted feedback entry from `npm run instruction:feedback -- --add ...` before editing and keep the entry id in handoff evidence.
- Run `instruction-artifact-reviewer` before the edit with the target artifact, recurrence path, draft rule, and replay evidence; block on conflict, cohesion, scope, or replay-signal findings.
- Apply the smallest rule edit that addresses the recurrence path; remove or merge stale overlapping guidance instead of adding a broad override.
- Run the replay gate by sending the same replay evidence to the same reviewer after the edit. Close the feedback entry only after `applied -> replayed -> resolved`; if replay is `still-failing`, reopen and create a new entry against the applied rule.

## Output

For review-only work, return:

- `Verdict`: clean | minor tuning | material tuning needed | blocked.
- `Scope`: files and artifact types reviewed.
- `Findings`: severity, evidence, impact, likely root cause, recommendation, confidence.
- `Tuning Opportunities`: minimal edits or split/move suggestions.
- `Validation`: checks run or explicitly skipped with reason.
- `Runtime/Installed Evidence`: installed drift, active config, loader docs/source/live checks, or explicit gaps when in scope.
- `Residual Risks`: missing evals, unverified loader behavior, or model-version sensitivity.
- `Actionable Continuation Items`: concrete follow-up tasks, including OpenSpec follow-up candidates when several session-scoped items remain, or `none`.

For implementation work, also return changed files and mention that running OpenCode sessions may need restart or a new session before changed skills/agents are loaded.
